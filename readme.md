### COP290 Task 1, Subtask 1 
by Kushal Kumar Gupta, 2020CS10355



#### Source Code description and functionalities:

*task1subtask1.cpp* uses `STL Vectors` with `32 bit float` as datatype to implement matrices. This guarantees a tolerance of`< 1e-5`.

The following matrix operations are supported:

**1.Fully connected layer:** fully connected (FC) layer that computes inner product of an input matrix of dimensions `AxB` and a weight matrix of dimensions `BxC`, to output a matrix of dimension `AxC`. To this output, a bias vector of dimension `AXC` is then added elementwise. Here, NaÃ¯ve matrix multiplication has been implemented. 

**2.Non-linear activations: **Non-linear activations of an input matrix of any size with [`relu`](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning) and [`tanh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function) functions on individual matrix elements.

**3.Subsampling with pooling:** Subsampling of square input matrices of any size with [`max pooling`](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Max-pooling_/_Pooling) and average pooling functions.  Stride length is required as a parameter for the pooling process. The output matrix is a square matrix of dimension `(n/ Stride)`

**4.Softmax and Sigmoid functions:** Converting a vector of random floats to a vector of probabilities with [`softmax and sigmoid functions`](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/03/07/difference-between-softmax-function-and-sigmoid-function/).

#### Input/Output data format:

Each input matrix/ vector should be stored in a different file. The output matrix/ vector is stored in the file whose name specified by the user. Note that the output file specified is overwritten if it exists or a new file is created if such a does not exist. The input and output file names/paths are passed as command line arguments.

The following file format is followed for all input/output matrix files: the first line will contain an integer denoting the column dimension, and the second line will denote row dimension. From the third line onwards, single float values are given in column major order in each line of the file. 

Similarly, for vector files: the first line will contain an integer denoting the length, and from the second line onwards, single float values are given in each line of the file.

#### How to use:

For using any of the above functionalities, go to the directory of source code (which also contains the `Makefile)` on your terminal and type on the terminal:

```bash
make
```

This generates an executable `./yourcode.out`

Now,

###### 1.Fully connected layer

Type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out fullyconnected inputmatrix.txt weightmatrix.txt biasmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
```



where `inputmatrix.txt, weightmatrix.txt` and  `biasmatrix.txt` are placeholders for your files names (along with path if not in the current directory) having the input matrix, the weight matrix and the bias matrix respectively, as described above. 

The output matrix is stored in the file name given by the placeholder `outputmatrix.txt`.



###### 2.Non-linear activations

For applying the `relu` function, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out activation relu inputmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
```

For applying the `tanh` function, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out activation tanh inputmatrix.txt outputmatrix.txt
```

where `inputmatrix.txt` is a placeholder for your files name (along with path if not in the current directory) having the input matrix as described above. 

The output matrix is stored in the file name given by the placeholder `outputmatrix.txt`.



###### 3.Subsampling with pooling

For subsampling of square input matrices of any size with `max pooling`, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out pooling max inputmatrix.txt stride outputmatrix.txt
```



For subsampling of square input matrices of any size with `average pooling`, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out pooling average inputmatrix.txt stride outputmatrix.txt
```



where `inputmatrix.txt` is a placeholder for your files name (along with path if not in the current directory), having the input matrix as described above.  `stride` is the positive integer parameter required for the pooling process and should be a factor of input matrix row length and column length.

The output matrix is stored in the file name given by the placeholder `outputmatrix.txt`.



###### 4.Softmax and Sigmoid functions

For converting a vector of random floats to a vector of probabilities with `softmax`, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out probability softmax inputvector.txt outputvector.txt
```

For converting a vector of random floats to a vector of probabilities with `sigmoid`, type on the terminal

```bash
./yourcode.out probability sigmoid inputvector.txt outputvector.txt
```

where `inputvector.txt` is a placeholder for your files name (along with path if not in the current directory), having the input vector as described above. 

The output vector is stored in the file name given by the placeholder `outputvector.txt`.
