### COP290
#### by Kushal Kumar Gupta and Divyanshu Agarwal
Implemented a small audio processing library in C++ using Deep Neural Networks which takes 1 second audio
samples and detects the word spoken from a predetermined set of keywords. The DNN comprises of 4 fully connected layers. Implemented matrix multiplication using my own multithreading and also MKL and OpenBlas libraries, and made performance comparisons using gnuplot.

- The project has been built over 3 stages. You can open these folders and view the individual readme files. 
- Or, to view the final audio processing DNN, you can directly open task 3.
